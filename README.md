## My process

### Built with

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Nodejs
- Bootstrap

### Continued development

To be more practical, there should apply waiting list to application when the user enroll to be a group member or to play in the court, which may make database much more complex. Also, it will be more convenient to combine with social media to add functions like sending message and transact money, though I am still looking for App that has lower price of usage of data transfer.
